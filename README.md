1. Real_Fake face identification refers to the detection of fake or synthetic faces; it usually involves identifying artificially generated faces or manipulated images that may be used to deceive facial recognition systems.

2. Detecting fake or synthetic faces can be challenging because modern techniques have become quite sophisticated. However, researchers are continuously developing algorithms and methods to tackle this issue. These methods often involve analyzing facial features, texture inconsistencies or using machine learning approaches to differentiate between real and fake faces.

3. It's worth noting that the technology and techniques in this field are continually evolving, and it's advisable to consult the latest research and advancements in the field for the most up-to-date information on real-time face identification and the detection of fake faces.

4. I have considered total 1OOK-Images retrieved from the link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xhlulu/140k-real-and-fake-faces. 

5. I have used the transformer approach and achieved 100% accuracy for 20,000 test images (fake-9980 | real-10020).
